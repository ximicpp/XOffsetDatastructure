XOffsetDatastructure is a serialization library designed to reduce or even eliminate the performance consumption of serialization and deserialization by utilizing zero-encoding and zero-decoding. It is also a collection of high-performance data structures designed for efficient read and in-place/non-in-place write, with performance comparable to STL.
